# Birthday Greeter App

This project was my first attempt at developing a Web Application in Ruby.

This birthday greeter app allows the end user to enter their name and birthday. If their Birthday is today's date it sends them a Birthday Greeting, otherwise it tells the user how many days it is until their Birthday.
